Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Initial repo commit (this is just me creating the github repo).

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Created 3 files index.html script.js and styles.css as well as creating the basic outline for
    the html file including default fields normally included in an html file.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Linked the proper style sheets and other sources to properly include bootstrap into the project.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Moved around the file structure of the project as well as added an example png, basically just put
    files into sub dirs and properly relinked them.  Also created a gitignore to ignore ds_store
    that was being created.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Created a topbar nav menu as an example from the tutorial that was linked on the project page.
    This is just so I can get working with some subpages although the top bar is a bit bugged out
    at the moment because the version of bootstrap I included was not the correct one.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Created an example page to serve as a sub dirrectory to test the navagation bar and that everything
    is linking to the correct page.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Fixed the issue with the version of bootstrap we were running and downgraded to an older version in
    order to allow the navbar to be properly displayed.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Changes the coloration on the navbar and webpage to be more of a darkmode.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Properly setup the timeline subpage to the navbar so it actually links correctly.  This is more of a
    proof of concept as the # I was using before just 404ed.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Fixed website from 404ing when clicking the same link twice.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Deleted some of the example files I had put into folder.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 24 2023]:
    Created all of the sub pages that I exspect that will we need in the future as well as properly populating the
    navagation bar with the correct links.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 25 2023]:
    Creating a javascript function that can be easily added to every page that modifys the DOM in order to include the
    navagation bar at the top of the body when the page is loaded.

Zufall, Jadon, [Jan 25 2023]:
    Fixed the topbar to the top of the window so that it will scroll with the user and not disappear off their screen.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 25 2023]:
    I added the content/paragraph under the Awards heading.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I deleted the placeholder title and added our real website title. I also added a bulleted list of potential links that would guide someone through our website.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I added the section function to create content and paragraphs under the About header.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I changed my mind and replaced what I deleted in the previous commit.


Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I added a section for the "Top Hits" header.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I added a section for Tour Dates.

Jadon, Zufall [Jan 27 2023]:
    Created static site hosting using github pages so that we could easily preview the website for those that are working only
    from github.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I added a list of Taylor Swift's top songs. I am planning on putting links to youtube videos eventually under each song.

Cassidy, Norkett [Jan 27 2023]:
    I added a paragraph function and a placeholder for a link to Taylor Swift's tour dates. (Her own website most likely)
