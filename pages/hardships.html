            <h1>Hardships</h1>
          <p>As a female pop artist, Taylor Swift has had her fair share of hardships in show business. Taylor Swift has faced backlash for 
            the muse of her songwriting, the awards that she has won, and rejection from producers and record companies. The hardships and 
            derailments only seemed to make her stronger as a singer and a woman.</p>

          <h2>Kanye West and Taylor Swift: VMAs 2009</h2>
          <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/what-did-kanye-west-do-to-taylor-swift-at-the-grammys#:~:text=Kanye%20West%20interrupted%20Taylor%20Swift,best%20videos%20of%20all%20time!%20%22"> Kanye West and Taylor Swift VMAs 2009</a>
          <p>In 2009, Taylor Swift won a VMA for 'Video of the Year.' When Taylor Swift walked on stage to give her acceptance speech, she was interrupted by Kanye West 
            who took the microphone and stated, "I'mma let you finish, but Beyonc√© had one of the best videos of all time, one of the best videos of all time!"
            This moment was stolen from Taylor Swift and started a feud with West which placed turmoil on her career. However, her fan base, the 'Swifties,' had her back 
            and she had more support than ever.</p>
