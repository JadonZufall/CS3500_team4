            <a href="https://www.albanystudentpress.online/post/taylor-s-version-what-does-it-mean"> Taylor's Version History</a>
            <h2>We all know that Taylor Swift keeps coming out with new music, but something occurred in 2021 that surprised fans, and confused some of her audience. Taylor Swift dropped an album, but it was not a completely new album. It was titled, <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i>. 'Red' had already come out in 2012. What was it doing beign re-released in 2021, nearly a decade later?</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>What Does <i>Taylor's Version</i> Mean?</h3>
            <p>'Taylor's Version' essentially means that Taylor Swift now owns the master to that album and the songs on them. This means that she is now the person who decides who can use her music and where. That legal action has to go through her now.</p>
            <p>Taylor decided to do this because her masters were in the hands of a man named Braunn. In order to get the right to her music back, she was told that she had to create six new albums under the authority of Braunn. Taylor was rightfully frustrated by this, so she found a loophole in order to obtain the rights to her music right away.</p>
            <p>The six new albums she would create are re-recordings of her past six albums, with more songs added as well as changes to the already recorded songs.</p>
            <p>As of this year, Taylor has re-recorded and released two of her six albums, <i>'Red'</i> and <i>'Fearless'</i>.

          <h3>'Red (Taylor's Version)'</h3>
          <p>The second re-recording came out November 12, 2021. The original album included 16 songs. The re-recorded 'Taylor's Version' album has 30 songs. Half of these songs have never been released and were a part of what Taylor calls, 'From the Vault.' These are songs that Taylor had wanted on the album, but they were never able to be a part of that release.</p>
          <p>Many fans were ecstatic. Not only because there were 14 more songs that they had never heard before from that era, but because Taylor Swift, herself, now owned that music.</p>

          <h3>'Fearless (Taylor's Version)</h3>
          <p>The first re-recording and the last to-date, is <i>'Fearless (Taylor's Version)'</i>. This album originally had 13 songs. The re-recorded <i>'Fearless (Taylor's Version)'</i> album contains 27 songs, with the extra tracks coming 'From the Vault.'</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Why Listen to 'Taylor's Version'?</h3>
          <p>A lot of people are asking why her fans are only listening to the <i>(Taylor's Version)'</i> tracks and albums. This is out of respect to Taylor. If her fans listen to only these songs, since Taylor is the only owner of these tracks, the owner of the non-Taylor's Version albums, will not benefit from fans listening to the albums that he owns.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Taylor Swift has been working hard and plans to re-record and release the remaining four albums. This project is not only liberating for Taylor, but it is an awesome way for her fans, the 'Swifties,' to hear more of her music that they did not get the chance to listen to during those album eras.</p>
